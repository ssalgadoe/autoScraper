In this work, vehicle listing data is collected from a well known auto resale web portal. Web scrawler application is developed using Python Scrapy to navigate through vehicle listing pages recursively to collect all available information including auto make, model, condition, year, mileage, body type, drivetrain, fuel type, interior/exterior color,  engine, transmission, doors and seats. A number of experiments including prediction model to approximate vehicle resale value based on above mentioned attributes and descriptive analytics such as market trends and demands are investigated. (This data is exclusively used for academic research and  auto inventory data is not used in any commercial application)
